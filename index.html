                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>
                    Hi, thanks for visiting my website! I recently finished my 3rd year of study in computing at Queen's
                    University.
                    I'm a passionate member of the computing community and I've been involved in multiple clubs
                    including QVEX- one of Canada's
                    most innovative and highly ranked VEX U Robotics teams- as a software and electrical team member. I
                    was also the internal
                    affairs coordinator of COMPSA, where I worked with other people within and outside of
                    the organization to run elections and hold internal events, as well as updating policies and manuals
                    that members of the organization
                    follow.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm currently away from university to pursue a 12-month internship with Ericsson.
                </p>

                            <li>Tasked with overseeing the internal affairs of the organization and ensure proceedings run smoothly during council meetings and general assembly where decisions impacting over 1000 students are made.</li>
                            <li>Ensure that constitution and policies align with organization/school values and incorporating them into activities and initiatives.</li>
                            <li>Planning COMPSA council elections for executives and directors by gathering nominations, overseeing campaigning periods, and managing polls. Successfully coordinated with other organizations to execute, while working with marketing team to achieve a voter turnout of over 450 eligible students.</li>

                            <li>My intention is not to copy every feature, but to make a web app with a very similar premise. I do not intend to implement every feature that X has, but to focus on major functionalities and original features not seen in X.</li>
                            <li>Implements the Spring Boot/Security architectures to handle requests such as stateless authentication/registration and interaction with users and posts through secure REST APIs.</li>
                            <li>The React-powered frontend mimics the original's to a degree, and it enables the intended user experiences- whether it be recreated or original.</li>
                            <li>The unique features aim to emphasize internet subcultures and styles of communication that Gen Z is familiar with. One such example is the emote system, which allows for non-standard emoticons that align with references, ideas, and humour that Gen Z is familiar with.</li>
